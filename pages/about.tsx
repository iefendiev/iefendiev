        Hello! I am Ä°pek. I am a frontend developer who loves creating useful
        products with modern frontend technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am based in Izmir / Turkey ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· at the moment. I graduated from Chemical
        Engineering at Izmir Institute of Technology in 2021. After that, I took
        a path to become a frontend developer and got my first job! Since then,
        I have developed and contributed to many projects and the ride still
        goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to spend time on the internet mostly. Other than that, I ride
        bicycles when I find the chance!
      </p>
